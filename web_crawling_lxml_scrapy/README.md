Web crawling: from lxml to scrapy

#### **What is this?**
This is the auxiliary code to my medium article "Web crawling: from lxml to scrapy" that gives a quick introduction to crawling and scraping using Python.

#### **What is included here?**
In here I included both scrapers mentioned in the article.

* `requests_and_lxml.py`: Requests+Lxml scraper
* `webscraper/`: Includes scrapy default project + custom spider
* `webscraper/webscraper/spiders/webscraper.py`: Custom scrapy spider
